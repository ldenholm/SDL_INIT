# :palm_tree: SDL_INIT Learning Simple Direct Media Layer :palm_tree:

This project serves as a playground for me to experiment and learn the SDL graphics API.


## The plan
- Build maps in Tiled map editor. 
- Use TMX Parser for C++ to enabled SDL to read these maps. TMXLite: https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite
- Work towards a platformer level with left/right and climbing animations for a single character.
- Experiment with building map editor and consider using Dear ImGui to build it: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
